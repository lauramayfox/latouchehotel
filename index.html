               <h2>The Past</h2>
               <br>
               <p>The La Touche Hotel in Greystones first opened as the Grand Hotel in 1894 after the arrival of the railway in the middle of the 19th century put the former fishing village on the Victorian tourist map. The hotel had some 40 rooms, including a billiards and smoking room and a ladies' dining room. A century later, it was the home of Lautrex nightclub, Bennigan's by the Sea, and those iconic 'Pound A Drink Thursdays'.</p>
               <br>
               <p>The opening of the hotel was recounted in The Freeman's Journal on June 4, 1894: 'The Grand Hotel, which has been built at Greystones, has just been opened, and on Saturday, a large number of gentlemen, in response to invitations issued by the Directors, attended a dinner given in the hotel in honour of the occasion. The new hotel is built quite near to the sea, so that when the tide is in, the water comes within a few yards of it.'</p>

               <h2>Interesting Fact</h2>
               <br>
               <p>War of Independence veteran Michael Collins was one of the guests to frequent the hotel 
                  over the years, and he proposed to Kitty Kiernan there on October 8, 1921.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>The couple's wedding was planned for October the following year, however, 
                  due to the ongoing civil war, the wedding was continuously postponed and rescheduled.
                  Sadly, the couple never got to marry in the end, as Collins was killed just a few 
                  months prior in August 1922.

               <h2>The Present</h2>
               <br>
               <p>The landmark Victorian building had been lain empty at the centre of the town since it's closure in 2004, 
                  growing increasingly derelict over the years. Since its closure, the building has survived a number 
                  of suspected arson attacks, water ingress after lead was removed from the roof, and the removal of 
                  fixtures from plumbing to the metal staircase bannisters.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>Fast forward to 2022, the former La Touche Hotel in Greystones is now transformed to a striking and 
                  luxurious residential development, a combination of apartments and town homes, 18 years after the hotel's closure.
