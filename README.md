# La Touche History

An exciting new archive website to document the past and present of a legendary Wicklow landmark,
The La Touche Hotel in Co. Wicklow. This site formally known as The Grand Hotel, later to be
renamed The La Touche Hotel has been the center of Greystones history for decades. 
I hope to provide a clear oversight on the history, with a user-friendly experience 
guiding the reader through the various reading and visual learning sections and leave them 
with a lasting impression of this old Greystones landmark.
