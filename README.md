# La Touche History

An exciting new archive website to document the past and present of a legendary Wicklow landmark,
The La Touche Hotel in Co. Wicklow. This site formally known as The Grand Hotel, later to be
renamed The La Touche Hotel has been the center of Greystones history for decades. 
I hope to provide a clear oversight on the history, with a user-friendly experience 
guiding the reader through the various reading and visual learning sections and leave them 
with a lasting impression of this old Greystones landmark.

Design Elements

The colour scheme was chosen to reflect the facade of the hotel from the early 2000s, which is how myself, and others who
live locally will best recount the landmark. 

I chose the signature shades from colour selection through one of the old photos of the front of the hotel.

Wireframes

In the planning stages, I had the idea that I wanted to use the hotel facade as the colour scheme, and once visualised, 
I took the idea into <a href="https://balsamiq.com/wireframes" target="_blank">Balsamiq Wireframes.</a>

My initial idea was very simply put together to try get a starting point for the project. Here is an image of the inital idea:

Research

I conducted online research into the hotel via archive groups on Facebook, as well as local press sites. I found several
article pieces and lots of old historical imagery to help me piece together my ideas for what the site could become.
