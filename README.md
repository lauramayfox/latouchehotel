# La Touche History

This project is intended for those who wish to look back on the history of the
La Touche Hotel, Greystones, Co. Wicklow, prior to it's closure. I hope to provide a
clear oversite on the history, with a user-friendly experience guiding the reader
through the various pages and leave them with a lasting impression with a thorough
knowledge of this old Greystones landmark.

# Features

Navigation Bar

The navigation bar was created following along and using code derived from the 'Love Running' project demo. This was one of the harder  parts of the project for me at the very begining as I origionally set out to try and tackle it independently, but struggled being the first project. I took a step back and followed the project demo to give me bootstrap content to work with.


Landing Page

Hero Image - drawing attention and used for high landing page impact. Created using a fixed banner method using the help of several walk through articles and videos. Credit: Career & Tech HQ.

Sections with photos - Three main sections containing historical facts and accompanied by photos.


Footer 
I found a really great walk through video which helped me in the build for my footer. Credit: The Web Shala (YouTube).
I wanted to practice integrating responsive click through features on my footer and bulk it out, I followed the walk through videos from the linked content creator and adapted them to suit my website requirements. 


Gallery

The gallery consits of a full page taken up by various photos of the historical site. Code credit to StudyReadEducate for the hover effect when panning across the photo gallery.



Contact

The contact page consits of an illustration of the hotel circa early to mid 2000's which I did for a graphic design project last year. The contact form below was derived from a walk through lesson courtesy of W3Schools and edited via CSS with sizing and colours to suit the site.
