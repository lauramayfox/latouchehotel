# La Touche History

This project is intended for those who wish to look back on the history of the
La Touche Hotel, Greystones, Co. Wicklow est. in the 1900s. I hope to provide a
clear oversite on the history, with a user-friendly experience guiding the reader
through the various pages and leave them with a lasting impression with a thorough
knowledge of this old Greystones landmark.
