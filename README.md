# La Touche History

An exciting new archive website to document the past and present of a legendary Wicklow landmark,
The La Touche Hotel in Co. Wicklow. This site formally known as The Grand Hotel, later to be
renamed The La Touche Hotel has been the center of Greystones history for decades. 
I hope to provide a clear oversight on the history, with a user-friendly experience 
guiding the reader through the various reading and visual learning sections and leave them 
with a lasting impression of this old Greystones landmark.

# Features

Design Elements

The colour scheme was chosen to reflect the facade of the hotel from the early 2000s, which is how myself, and others who
live locally will best recount the landmark. 

I chose the signature shades from colour selection through one of the old photos of the front of the hotel.

Wireframes

In the planning stages, I had the idea that I wanted to use the hotel facade as the colour scheme, and once visualised, 
I took the idea into <a href="https://balsamiq.com/wireframes" target="_blank">Balsamiq Wireframes.</a>

My initial idea was very simply put together to try get a starting point for the project. Here is an image of the inital idea:

Research

I conducted online research into the hotel via archive groups on Facebook, as well as local press sites. I found several
article pieces and lots of old historical imagery to help me piece together my ideas for what the site could become.

# Features

Navigation Bar
<h1 align="center"><img src="/assets/images/nav2.jpg"/></h1>
<ul>
<li>The navigation bar is featured on all 3 pages, fully responsive with links to the home page, gallery and contact sections.</li>
<li>It is designed with the user experience in mind for a clear link to each aspect of the site without any confusion.</li>
<li>Featured is the logo for the site "La Touche History", which can be clicked from any page to take you back to the landing homepage screen.</li>
</ul>
<h1 align="left"><img src="/assets/images/nav1.jpg"/></h1>
<li>The smaller screen size contains a hamburger icon, which when clicked, displays a drop down menu.
</ul>


Landing Page

The landing page hero image has been positioned for high impact made with a fixed banner effect, a transition and text overlay with the year that the hotel was established.
<h1 align="left"><img src="/assets/images/heroimg.jpg"/></h1>

Home page text section

Three sections have been created to show the past, present and facts to the reader. Each section is layed out clearly with bright pops
of colour reflecting the facade of the hotel along with imagery for each section to engage the viewer.
<h1 align="left"><img src="/assets/images/section.jpg"/></h1>

Here you can see the responsive design working in the homepage section on smaller screen size. The section width becomes less, as more text takes up the screen width.

Footer 

The footer features four colums with responsive click-through features upon hover and click. Each clicked link will take you directly to the next part of the site, and all external links will automatically open in a new browser tab to maintain and encourage site users to remain on the main website itself.
Links to the social media are included via their well known logos embedded on the footer, which contain a colour change feature upon hover on desktops and laptop screens.

Gallery

The Gallery provides the reader with interesting historical imagery of the interior, as well as the many different exteriors of the La
Touche Hotel. Each image has it's own caption, within an orange border in keeping with the colour scheme, and a click through to extend the image on larger screens.

<h1 align="center"><img src="/assets/images/gallery.jpg"/></h1>



Contact

The contact page consits of an illustration of the hotel facade, with the contact input details positioned below. The illustration was apart of a graphic design project I did in 2023.

<h1 align="center"><img src="/assets/images/contact.jpg"/></h1>

Below the illustration image of the hotel, there is a contact section where the reader is invited to get in touch with any feedbacks, news submissions or general questions in relation to the history of the hotel.

Each text field has a requirement for input before submission.

<h1 align="center"><img src="/assets/images/contact2.jpg"/></h1>

# Features Left To Implement

<ul>
<li>In the future I would like to split the gallery into another page where reader's own submissions can be posted and keep a separate archive gallery for the older pictures that can be found online.</li>
<li>Another page idea would be to create an entire timeline, with dates, facts and pictures throughout the years.</li>
<li>A FAQ section to answer the questions that are likely going to be asked through the contact form</li>
<li>An online store which will feature merchandise and art relating to the old hotel, potentially in collaboration with local artists.</li>
</ul>

# Testing

<ul>
<li>The site has been tested on Chrome, Safari & Firefox</li>
<li>Testing has been implemented on various screen sizes to ensure responsivness across devices. Ipad, Galaxy and laptop testing has been implemented and passed.</li>
<li>Social media links, footer links and other page links as well as contact form validation have all been tested and passed. </li>
</ul>

Lighthouse report:

I'm overall generally happy with the lighthouse report. The score of 99 when looking at the diagnostics seems to be related to some of the imagery file size.

# Bugs/Errors
<ul>
<li>I fixed some intitial bugs relating to hierarchy on the homepage. The hero image text was warning me not to use H1, as the header already contained an H1 element. Same issue on the footer with hierarchy and headers. Both issues resolved.</li>

<li>The CSS had some bug fixes relating to extra brackets which was fixed.</li>

Unfixed Bugs

<li>Unresolved bug - hero image working fine on dev tools when inspecting smaller screen sizes, 
not loading properly on an actual phone screen.</li>
</ul>
